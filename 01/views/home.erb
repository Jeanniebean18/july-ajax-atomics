<h2>1. Why are you able to make requests to /info1 and /info2 even though there are no route handlers for those paths defined in app.rb?</h2>
<p>We are only making request/response calls to the server without leaving the page, not leaving the page to a new view. Thus, we do not need a path since we are not leaving the page. </p>

<h2>Why is the XHR object's request path /info1 instead of /public/info1?</h2>
<p>We can use files in /public like they are in the base directory, just like any css file we reference in Sinatra.  Sinatra reads files in public as if they are in the root directory of the webpage</p>

<h2>Within the addEventListener function, what does this represent?</h2>
<p>`This` refers to 'req' which is a variable we set to the the XHR Request function.</p>
